This is example of Test Driven Development for Lab work 5.

We have class buffer -- container that stores N elements of type T. 

- You can add element into it.
- You can view last N elements in order they were added.
- You can clean buffer, making all elements equal default value.

Development of class Buffer (headers/Buffer.h) is driven by 3 consequtive tests:

1. Buffer cannot be overflown by adding elements (it must delete old).
2. Buffer must correctly output last N elements.
3. Buffer must clean up correctly.

By TDD addition of each test results in addition of corresponding method in class Buffer (1 - add, 2 - output, 3 - clean).
